-----FACE SECURED CAR-----

Greetings, Dear Judges
I thereby present you my functional prototype based on Challenge-1 (Facial Recognition).

This prototype is based on the application of car theft security system, which in my opinion is one of the biggest problems in our country.
With increasing thefts in our country, this sytstem uses facial recognition to detect any anonymous faces inside the owner's car and recognize it based on the owner.
Everytime camera detects a different face, owner is notified through push notifications and he has the option to either accept or reject the face (accpet in the case he/he is their family member).
The owner can also press a button which would buzz the car loudly informing the neighbours and people on the street about a possible theft being carried out.
